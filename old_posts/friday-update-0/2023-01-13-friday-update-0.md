title: Friday Update 1 - Creating A Podcast

About 6 years ago I started listening to podcasts in the personal development realm, and about 2 years ago I decided that I would start my own podcast once I had the bandwidth.

Now is the time.

My plan is to interview people that have actionable insights on how to build a better life. I have some ideas for my first guest, and more will be revealed on that soon.

I have spent the last week studying and planning how to create a podcast. I want to start interviewing people as soon as possible, but I wanted to develop somewhat of an online presence before reaching out to potential guests.

Here's the things I did this week to prepare:

- Made a twitter and posted a few tweets while having 1 follower
- Converted my personal website (this one) into a website for the podcast
- Had a professional headshot taken
- Created a basic logo
- Kept detailed notes about everything I'm thinking and learning about podcast creation

In software engineering there's something called an MVP (minimum viable product). It is exactly what it sounds like: the most basic, usable version of a product. The idea is that you create an MVP and then iterate to make it better.

That is how I am approaching this podcast.

I want to keep my Friday updates short and sweet. I'm looking forward to building the Jimmy Neville Podcast, and I will be posting again next Friday.

Talk to you all again soon :)
