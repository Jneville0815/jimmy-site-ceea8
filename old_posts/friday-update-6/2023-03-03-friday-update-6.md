The 7th Monday Update is here! It was supposed to be here last Friday, but I ended up forgetting about it and then deciding to skip it because I was busy moving into a new house.

There was an interview scheduled for Monday and Tuesday this week, but both ended up being cancelled. I'm still waiting to see if they are going to reschedule.

I have three episodes that have been recorded and will be edited and released over the next few Mondays. I also have two more episodes scheduled to record. I need to get more people on the schedule.

This week I have been so busy with moving and getting settled into my new house that I have not done much with the podcast. Going to get back in the groove this week.

The two episodes that have been released got great feedback. This should only get better with time.

Signing off until next week :)
