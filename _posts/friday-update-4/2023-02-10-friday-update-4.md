Welcome to another Friday Update!

As of right now, I have two podcast recorded and ready to go, two podcasts scheduled to record, and two people that have agreed to do an interview.

I'm super pumped to prepare for the two interviews coming up this week. I will talk about my first guest in the next update.

Preparing, recording, building, and organizing for the podcast has been a lot of fun. I'm starting to see that I really enjoy building things. I really appreciate a good challenge.

Another plan for the following week is to make an "about me" page for the website. Here I can explain who I am and why I'm creating a podcast.

I have all of the necessary pieces in place and can't wait to start releasing episodes on February 20th.

Stay tuned for more updates :)
