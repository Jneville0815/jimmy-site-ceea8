title: Friday Update 2 - Finding People To Interview

This week I have been putting a lot of time and thought into how to approach the podcast.

As I interview people, I want to shine a light on them and help them express their ideas in a way that everyone can understand. I also want to make sure that I'm bringing the unique aspects of my personality and experience to the conversation.

I have reached out to several potential guests this week and have heard back from a few of them. I am hoping to get their interview scheduled and recorded as soon as possible.

My plan, for now, is to release 1 episode per week. I want to have about 5 episodes recorded and ready to publish before I release the first episode.

I am hoping to be releasing the first episode in about 1 month.

I will keep you updated :)
