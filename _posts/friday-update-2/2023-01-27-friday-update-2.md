title: Friday Update 3 - First Two Interviews

In the last week I did my first two interviews; one of them is a good friend of mine, and the other one is a person that I met online.

Both interviews went great. I cannot wait to get them edited and released. The first episode will be released on Monday, February 20th, and then another episode will be released every following Monday.

Finding guests when I have no audience has been pretty hard. I realized that some of the most interesting people I know are my friends, so I am going to start asking more of my friends if they want to come on the podcast.

When I ask someone to come on the show, I want to be sure that I'm doing my best to prepare for the interview so that I ask engaging questions. I also want to make sure that I put 100% of my effort into editing the episode so that the final product is high-quality.

Each time I record and edit an episode I will learn ways to improve and evolve.

This process has been more fun and more challenging than I would have thought, but it feels right.

Stay tuned for more updates :)
