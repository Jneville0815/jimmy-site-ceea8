Some really cool things happened over the last week...

1. I finished my [strength training 3 month challange](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/boring-but-big-3-month-challenge/).

2. After thinking that I was moving into a new house on Feb 6th, the house didn't appraise, so I had to start back at square one.

3. I found a new house that I like a lot more than the first house, and if the inspection and appraisal goes well, I will be moving in on Feb 21st.

After finding out my house didn't appraise, I started getting stressed out and had a hard time living in the moment.

When I'm failing to live in the moment because I'm in my head, I am not in my optimal state. I believe that things tend to work out when I put in the needed work and then trust that things will work out how they are supposed to work out.

I never want to get too fixated on an outcome. When I'm living in the moment, life tends to go well.

For the next few weeks I'm going to be living in an airbnb with my dogs. I have a few podcast guests lined up and cannot wait to start releasing episodes. The first episode will be relased on Feb 20th.

Another update will be released next Friday :)
