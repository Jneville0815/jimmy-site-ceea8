Welcome to the 6th Friday Update for the Jimmy Neville Podcast!

As of now, I have recorded 3 episodes and have 5 episodes scheduled to record.

The first episode will be released this coming Monday, and then another episode will be released every Monday.

In the preparation for the last interview I did, I ended up asking chatGPT to help me come up with questions. It ended up feeling like cheating, and I don't plan on doing it again. I would rather take more time to do the research myself and come up with questions that I'm genuinely curious about.

It has been difficult to find my groove while interviewing someone. It's hard for me to stay present in the conversation while also keeping in mind the questions that I want to ask. I'm sure this is something that will improve over time.

These are things that I knew would be challenging when I decided to start a podcast, but I knew that I would get better as I got more experience. There are many aspects to improve on right now, and that's one of the reasons this is fun and interesting for me.

I will talk to you all again next week :)
